Building data products. Programming experience required.\n\nAdditional Course Description\nThis course is a tour of programming techniques for building data pipelines for analytics. It will not just emphasize exploratory approaches, but also techniques to build extract-transform-load pipelines to run code in production. Throughout the course we will learn how to source data from a variety of sources (files, data streams, APIs, web scraping, etc.) and ultimately transform data as to prepare it for dashboards or machine learning. You will also learn some simple data visualization but that is not the primary emphasis of the course.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis courses uses the Python programming language. Proficiency in any programming language is the only pre-requisite. Students should have a clear understanding of these concepts:\n\nInput, output, variables and data types\nControl flow statements (if, for, while)\nFunctions (function definition, calling, parameters, return values)\nData structures (lists, dictionaries)\nUsing code in other libraries\n\n\n\nAudience: IST256 or IST356?\nThis course is intended as a follow up course to IST256. It is also appropriate for students with prior experience with programming who have an interest in data analytics.\n\nIST256 is for students with little to no programming experience. The course content is 75% python fundamentals and 25% python for data analytics.\nIST356 is for students with prior programming experience. The course content is 25% python fundamentals and 75% python for data analytics.\n\n\n\nCredits\n3 credits\n\n\nCourse Fees\nNone",

As we progress through the course, the tutorials and lecture material we go over in class will be added to the website. Most, if not all, the material you need will be on the website, with links provided to any additional resources. All of these resources will be available freely online. In many cases, the online sources are the most up-to-date references to the relevant course material.\nThat said, if you would like a traditional textbook on Python programming, you may find the following useful:\n\nPython Programming for Data Science, by T. Beuzen (2021) https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/\n\n\n\nBring Your Own Device\nYou are expected to bring your computer to each class session. This class is very hands-on, and you will be programming in class often.\n\nSoftware to install\nThis course requires you to install software on your computer. The intro section of this course provides detailed instructions.\n\nVisual Studio Code editor\nGit Source Code Managment\nMiniconda\n\n\n\nAccounts\n\nWe will use Github for assignment submission.",

    "text": "Course Requirements and Expectations\n\nAttendance and Participation\nIn-class participation is the best way to learn and absorb the material. As such, you are expected to attend and participate in every class session. Your grade will be partially based on attendance (see below for details). If you must miss class, you are responsible for making up the work and catching up on what you missed. Lectures will be recorded and posted to the course website after the class.\n\n\nLecture recordings\nAll lectures will be recorded by the professor and made available to you to review when doing assignments/studying for exams. Recordings will primarily be of the professor’s screen as we walk through tutorials; any video will just be of the professor. The mic will mostly record the professor’s voice, although student voices may occassionally be picked up in the background.\nPer university policy, if all students provide written permission to make recordings publicly available (I will circulate a permission letter), the lecture recordings will be made available through the course website.\n\n\nAssignments\nThe assignments are programming / problem solving activities that you will complete outside of class. The assignment due dates are posted on the course schedule. Consider these assignments formative assessments - practice so you can get better at computational thinking, problem solving and writing code. It is important to reflect upon your work and take an honest assessment of your abilities as you complete each assignment.\nEach Wednesday we will review the homework assignment. Students will be asked to contribute to the discussion.\nFactors affecting your grade:\n\nIs the code working and correct?\nWere the instructions followed? (e.g. commit after each function is written)\nGood reflection: specific, uses terminology, actionable\nHanded in on time, so I only need to review submissions one time.\n\n\n\nExams\nExams are summative assessments. They are designed to test your knowledge of the material. The exams will be issued in class on the dates posted on the course schedule. Exams are closed-book but you may bring one 8.5x11 sheet of paper with your notes on it. Exams length is 60 minutes. They will be a mix of mix of multiple choice, short answer and code tracing and code writing.\n\n\nProject\nThe project is your opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned in an experiential fashion. In your final project you will be expected to create a data pipeline of your choosing.\n\nThe pipeline should incorporate techniques we learned in the course and the more techniques you incorporate correctly the higher your grade.\nIt is expected that you will be able to explain your choices, and they will be appropriate for the problem.\nThe pipeline should be first written exploratory, and then refactored into a production quality pipeline. Both pipelines should be submitted.\nThere should be a simple data visualization or dashboard from the pipeline output as to demonstrate its usefulness.",

Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be viewed by visiting the Syracuse University Policies website.\nUpholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\nStudents found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.",

    "text": "The prompt\nWhen the shell is first opened, you are presented with a prompt, indicating that the shell is waiting for input.\n$\nThe shell typically uses $ as the prompt, but may use a different symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we’ll show the prompt as $. Most importantly, do not type the prompt when typing commands. Only type the command that follows the prompt. This rule applies both in these lessons and in lessons from other sources. Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the Enter key to execute it.\nThe prompt is followed by a text cursor, a character that indicates the position where your typing will appear. The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe. You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.\nNote that your prompt might look a little different. In particular, most popular shell environments by default put your user name and the host name before the $. Such a prompt might look like, e.g.:\ncdcapano@localhost $\nThe prompt might even include more than this. Do not worry if your prompt is not just a short $. This lesson does not depend on this additional information and it should also not get in your way. The only important item to focus on is the $ character itself and we will see later why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneOPTIONAL: Change your prompt to $\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to simplify your prompt for the purposes of this tutorial, copy and paste the code below into your terminal:\nPS1='$ '\n\n\nSo let’s try our first command, ls, which is short for listing. This command will list the contents of the current directory:\n$ ls\nDesktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures\nDocuments   Library     Music       Public\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCommand not found\n\n\n\nIf the shell can’t find a program whose name is the command you typed, it will print an error message such as:\n$ ks\nks: command not found\nThis might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command is not installed.\n\n\n\nA Typical Problem\nYou are a marine biologist who has just returned from a six-month survey of the North Pacific Gyre, where you have sampled gelatinous marine life in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. You have 1520 samples that you’ve run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins. You need to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called goostats.sh. In addition to this huge task, you have to write up results by the end of the month, so your paper can appear in a special issue of Aquatic Goo Letters.\nIf you choose to run goostats.sh by hand using a GUI, you’ll have to select and open a file 1520 times. If goostats.sh takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours. With the shell, you can instead assign your computer this mundane task while you focuses her attention on writing your paper.\nThe next few lessons will explore the ways you can achieve this. More specifically, the lessons explain how you can use a command shell to run the goostats.sh program, using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names, so that your computer can work while you write your paper.\nAs a bonus, once you have put a processing pipeline together, you will be able to use it again whenever you collect more data.\nIn order to achieve your task, you need to know how to:\n\nnavigate to a file/directory\ncreate a file/directory\ncheck the length of a file\nchain commands together\nretrieve a set of files\niterate over files\nrun a shell script containing your pipeline\n\nDownload files:\nYou need to download some files to follow this lesson.\n\nDownload shell-lesson-data.zip and move the file to your Desktop.\nUnzip/extract the file. Let your instructor know if you need help with this step. You should end up with a new folder called shell-lesson-data on your Desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nA shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.\nThis lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix.\nPrograms can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.\nThe shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.\nA significant challenge when using the shell can be knowing what commands need to be run and how to run them.",

    "text": "Where am I?\nFirst, let’s find out where we are by running a command called pwd (which stands for ‘print working directory’). Directories are like places — at any time while we are using the shell, we are in exactly one place called our current working directory. Commands mostly read and write files in the current working directory, i.e. ‘here’, so knowing where you are before running a command is important. pwd shows you where you are:\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano\nThe computer’s response is /Users/cdcapano, which is my home directory.\n\nThe home directory\nThe home directory will look different on different operating systems.\n\nLinux: /home/cdcapano\nWindows: C:\\Users\\cdcapano (This may differ based on Windows versions)\n\nIf pwd returns something else, you may need to navigate to your home directory using the command cd.\nLet’s look at how a filesystem is organized:\n\nThe filesystem looks like an upside-down tree. We refer to the topmost directory as the “root directory”. It contains everything else. It is referred to with the / symbol.\nIn this illustration, we have several other directories stemming off of the root. The bin directory often refers to a location where programs are stored. tmp is a common directory on filesystems as a place to hold files that don’t need to be kept long-term. You may recognize the Users directory from the output we had above when typing pwd. We know the path of our home directory, where we currently are, is /Users/cdcapano.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSlashes\n\n\n\nThere are two meanings for the / character. When it appears at the front of a path, it means “root”, when it appears within a path, it acts as a separator.\n\n\n\nThe Users folder may have more than one directory in it. For example, the image below depicts two users, cdcapano and aturing. The home directory just as the home directory for cdcapano is /Users/cdcapano, the home directory for aturing would be /Users/aturing. Typically, when you open a new command prompt, you will start in your home directory by default",

    "section": "Exploring other directories",
    "text": "Exploring other directories\nNot only can we use ls on the current working directory, but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory. Let’s take a look at our Desktop directory by running ls -F Desktop, i.e., the command ls with the -F option and the argument Desktop. The argument Desktop tells ls that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:\n$ ls -F Desktop\nYou should see your newly created directory “workshop”\nshell-lesson-data/\nNote that if a directory named Desktop does not exist in your current working directory, this command will return an error. Typically, a Desktop directory exists in your home directory, which we assume is the current working directory of your bash shell.\nYour output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in your Desktop directory, including the shell-lesson-data directory you downloaded at the setup for this lesson. (On most systems, the contents of the Desktop directory in the shell will show up as icons in a graphical user interface behind all the open windows. See if this is the case for you.)\nOrganizing things hierarchically helps us keep track of our work. While it’s possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory just as it’s possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, it’s much easier to find things when they’ve been organized into sensibly-named subdirectories.\nNow that we know the shell-lesson-data directory is located in our Desktop directory, we can do two things.\nFirst, using the same strategy as before, we can look at its contents by passing a directory name to ls:\n$ ls -F Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nexercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/\nSecond, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so we are no longer located in our home directory.\nThe command to change locations is cd followed by a directory name to change our working directory. cd stands for ‘change directory’, which is a bit misleading. The command doesn’t change the directory; it changes the shell’s current working directory. In other words it changes the shell’s settings for what directory we are in. The cd command is akin to double-clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into that folder.\nLet’s say we want to move into the exercise-data directory we saw above. We can use the following series of commands to get there:\n$ cd Desktop\n$ cd shell-lesson-data\n$ cd exercise-data\nThese commands will move us from our home directory into our Desktop directory, then into the shell-lesson-data directory, then into the exercise-data directory. You will notice that cd doesn’t print anything. This is normal. Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed. But if we run pwd after it, we can see that we are now in /Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data.\nIf we run ls -F without arguments now, it lists the contents of /Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data, because that’s where we now are:\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data\n$ ls -F\nalkanes/  animal-counts/  creatures/  numbers.txt  writing/\nWe now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a subdirectory), but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into its parent directory)? We might try the following:\n$ cd shell-lesson-data\n-bash: cd: shell-lesson-data: No such file or directory\nBut we get an error! Why is this?\nWith our methods so far, cd can only see sub-directories inside your current directory. There are different ways to see directories above your current location; we’ll start with the simplest.\nThere is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level. It works as follows:\n$ cd ..\n.. is a special directory name meaning “the directory containing this one”, or more succinctly, the parent of the current directory. Sure enough, if we run pwd after running cd .., we’re back in /Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data:\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nThe special directory .. doesn’t usually show up when we run ls. If we want to display it, we can add the -a option to ls -F:\n$ ls -F -a\n./  ../  exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/\n-a stands for ‘show all’ (including hidden files); it forces ls to show us file and directory names that begin with ., such as .. (which, if we’re in /Users/cdcapano, refers to the /Users directory). As you can see, it also displays another special directory that’s just called ., which means ‘the current working directory’. It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we’ll see some uses for it soon.\nNote that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined with a single - and no spaces between the options; ls -F -a is equivalent to ls -Fa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOther Hidden Files\n\n\n\nIn addition to the hidden directories .. and ., you may also see a file called .bash_profile. This file usually contains shell configuration settings. You may also see other files and directories beginning with .. These are usually files and directories that are used to configure different programs on your computer. The prefix . is used to prevent these configuration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard ls command is used.\n\n\nThese three commands are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer: pwd, ls, and cd. Let’s explore some variations on those commands. What happens if you type cd on its own, without giving a directory?\n$ cd\nHow can you check what happened? pwd gives us the answer!\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano\nIt turns out that cd without an argument will return you to your home directory, which is great if you’ve got lost in your own filesystem.\nLet’s try returning to the exercise-data directory from before. Last time, we used three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories to move to exercise-data in one step:\n$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data\nCheck that we’ve moved to the right place by running pwd and ls -F.\nIf we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use cd ... But there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your current location.\nSo far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above), we have been using relative paths. When you use a relative path with a command like ls or cd, it tries to find that location from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.\nHowever, it is possible to specify the absolute path to a directory by including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a leading slash. The leading / tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.\nThis allows us to move to our shell-lesson-data directory from anywhere on the filesystem (including from inside exercise-data). To find the absolute path we’re looking for, we can use pwd and then extract the piece we need to move to shell-lesson-data.\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data\n$ cd /Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nRun pwd and ls -F to ensure that we’re in the directory we expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTwo more shortcuts\n\n\n\nThe shell interprets a tilde (~) character at the start of a path to mean “the current user’s home directory”. For example, if your home directory is /Users/cdcapano, then ~/data is equivalent to /Users/cdcapano/data. This only works if it is the first character in the path; here/there/~/elsewhere is not here/there/Users/cdcapano/elsewhere.\nAnother shortcut is the - (dash) character. cd will translate - into the previous directory I was in, which is faster than having to remember, then type, the full path. This is a very efficient way of moving back and forth between two directories – i.e. if you execute cd - twice, you end up back in the starting directory.\nThe difference between cd .. and cd - is that the former brings you up, while the latter brings you back.\n\nTry it!\nFirst navigate to ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data (you should already be there).\n$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nThen cd into the exercise-data/creatures directory\n$ cd exercise-data/creatures\nNow if you run\n$ cd -\nyou’ll see you’re back in ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data.

    "section": "General Syntax of a Shell Command",
    "text": "General Syntax of a Shell Command\nWe have now encountered commands, options, and arguments, but it is perhaps useful to formalise some terminology.\nConsider the command below as a general example of a command, which we will dissect into its component parts:\n$ ls -F /\n\nls is the command, with an option -F and an argument /. We’ve already encountered options which either start with a single dash (-), known as short options, or two dashes (--), known as long options. Options change the behavior of a command and arguments tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories). Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as parameters. A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument, but a command doesn’t always require an argument or an option.\nYou might sometimes see options being referred to as switches or flags, especially for options that take no argument. In this lesson we will stick with using the term option.\nEach part is separated by spaces. If you omit the space between ls and -F the shell will look for a command called ls-F, which doesn’t exist. Also, capitalization can be important. For example, ls -s will display the size of files and directories alongside the names, while ls -S will sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:\n$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\n$ ls -s exercise-data\ntotal 28\n 4 animal-counts   4 creatures  12 numbers.txt   4 alkanes   4 writing\nNote that the sizes returned by ls -s are in blocks. As these are defined differently for different operating systems, you may not obtain the same figures as in the example.\n$ ls -S exercise-data\nanimal-counts  creatures  alkanes  writing  numbers.txt\nPutting all that together, our command ls -F / above gives us a listing of files and directories in the root directory /. An example of the output you might get from the above command is given below:\n$ ls -F /\nApplications/         System/\nLibrary/              Users/\nNetwork/              Volumes/\n\nYour Task: Organizing Files\nKnowing this much about files and directories, You are ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.\nYou create a directory called north-pacific-gyre (to remind yourself where the data came from), which will contain the data files from the assay machine and your data processing scripts.\nEach of your physical samples is labelled according to your lab’s convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as ‘NENE01729A’. This ID is what you used in your collection log to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so you decide to use it within the filename of each data file. Since the output of the assay machine is plain text, you will call your files NENE01729A.txt, NENE01812A.txt, and so on. All 1520 files will go into the same directory.\nNow in your current directory shell-lesson-data, you can see what files you have using the command:\n$ ls north-pacific-gyre/\nThis command is a lot to type, but you can let the shell do most of the work through what is called tab completion. If you types:\n$ ls nor\nand then presses Tab (the tab key on her keyboard), the shell automatically completes the directory name for you:\n$ ls north-pacific-gyre/\nPressing Tab again does nothing, since there are multiple possibilities; pressing Tab twice brings up a list of all the files.\nIf you then presses G and then presses Tab again, the shell will append ‘goo’ since all files that start with ‘g’ share the first three characters ‘goo’.\n$ ls north-pacific-gyre/goo\nTo see all of those files, you can press Tab twice more.\nls north-pacific-gyre/goo\ngoodiff.sh   goostats.sh\nThis is called tab completion, and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nThe file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.\nInformation is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).\nDirectories can also store other directories, which then form a directory tree.\npwd prints the user’s current working directory.\nls [path] prints a listing of a specific file or directory; ls on its own lists the current working directory.\ncd [path] changes the current working directory.\nMost commands take options that begin with a single -.\nDirectory names in a path are separated with / on Unix, but \\ on Windows.\n/ on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.\nAn absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.\nA relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.\n. on its own means ‘the current directory’; .. means ‘the directory above the current one’.",

    "text": "Creating Directories and Files\nWe now know how to explore files and directories, but how do we create them in the first place?\nIn this episode we will learn about creating and moving files and directories, using the exercise-data/writing directory as an example.\n\nStep one: see where we are and what we already have\nWe should still be in the shell-lesson-data directory on the Desktop, which we can check using:\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nNext we’ll move to the exercise-data/writing directory and see what it contains:\n$ cd exercise-data/writing/\n$ ls -F\nhaiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt\n\n\nCreate a directory\nLet’s create a new directory called thesis using the command mkdir thesis (which has no output):\n$ mkdir thesis\nAs you might guess from its name, mkdir means ‘make directory’. Since thesis is a relative path (i.e., does not have a leading slash, like /what/ever/thesis), the new directory is created in the current working directory:\n$ ls -F\nhaiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt  thesis/\nSince we’ve just created the thesis directory, there’s nothing in it yet:\n$ ls -F thesis\nNote that mkdir is not limited to creating single directories one at a time. The -p option allows mkdir to create a directory with nested subdirectories in a single operation:\n$ mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results\nThe -R option to the ls command will list all nested subdirectories within a directory. Let’s use ls -FR to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created in the project directory:\n$ ls -FR ../project\n../project/:\ndata/  results/\n\n../project/data:\n\n../project/results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTwo ways of doing the same thing\n\n\n\nUsing the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer. If you open the current directory using your operating system’s graphical file explorer, the thesis directory will appear there too. While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files, the files and directories themselves are the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGood names for files and directories\n\n\n\nComplicated names of files and directories can make your life painful when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful tips for the names of your files and directories.\n\nDon’t use spaces.\n\nSpaces can make a name more meaningful, but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories. You can use - or _ instead (e.g. north-pacific-gyre/ rather than north pacific gyre/). To test this out, try typing mkdir north pacific gyre and see what directory (or directories!) are made when you check with ls -F.\n\nDon’t begin the name with - (dash).\n\nCommands treat names starting with - as options.\n\nStick with letters, numbers, . (period or ‘full stop’), - (dash) and _ (underscore).\n\nMany other characters have special meanings on the command line. We will learn about some of these during this lesson. There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as expected and can even result in data loss.\nIf you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces or other special characters, you should surround the name in single quotes ('').\n\n\n\n\nCreate a text file\nLet’s change our working directory to thesis using cd, then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called draft.txt:\n$ cd thesis\n$ nano draft.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhich editor?\n\n\n\nWhen we say, ‘nano is a text editor’ we really do mean ‘text’. It can only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS), many programmers use Emacs or Vim (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as Gedit or VScode. On Windows, you may wish to use Notepad++. Windows also has a built-in editor called notepad that can be run from the command line in the same way as nano for the purposes of this lesson.\nNo matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer’s start menu, it may want to save files in your Desktop or Documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you ‘Save As…’\n\n\nLet’s type a few lines of text:\n\nOnce we’re happy with our text, we can press Ctrl+O (press the Ctrl or Control key and, while holding it down, press the O key) to write our data to disk. We will be asked to provide a name for the file that will contain our text. Press Return to accept the suggested default of draft.txt.\nOnce our file is saved, we can use Ctrl+X to quit the editor and return to the shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipControl, Ctrl, or ^ Key\n\n\n\nThe Control key is also called the ‘Ctrl’ key. There are various ways in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may see an instruction to press the Control key and, while holding it down, press the X key, described as any of:\n\nControl-X\nControl+X\nCtrl-X\nCtrl+X\n^X\nC-x\n\nIn nano, along the bottom of the screen you’ll see ^G Get Help ^O WriteOut. This means that you can use Control-G to get help and Control-O to save your file.\n\n\nnano doesn’t leave any output on the screen after it exits, but ls now shows that we have created a file called draft.txt:\n$ ls\ndraft.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Creating Files a Different Way\n\n\n\nWe have seen how to create text files using the nano editor. Now, try the following command:\n$ touch my_file.txt\n\nWhat did the touch command do? When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer, does the file show up?\nUse ls -l to inspect the files. How large is my_file.txt?\nWhen might you want to create a file this way?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe touch command generates a new file called my_file.txt in your current directory. You can observe this newly generated file by typing ls at the command line prompt. my_file.txt can also be viewed in your GUI file explorer.\nWhen you inspect the file with ls -l, note that the size of my_file.txt is 0 bytes. In other words, it contains no data. If you open my_file.txt using your text editor it is blank.\nSome programs do not generate output files themselves, but instead require that empty files have already been generated. When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to populate with its output. The touch command allows you to efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such programs.\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid confusion later on, we suggest removing the file you’ve just created before proceeding with the rest of the episode, otherwise future outputs may vary from those given in the lesson. To do this, use the following command:\n$ rm my_file.txt\n\n\n\nWhat’s in a name?\nYou may have noticed that all of your files are named ‘something dot something’, and in this part of the lesson, we always used the extension .txt. This is just a convention; we can call a file mythesis or almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the filename extension and indicates what type of data the file holds: .txt signals a plain text file, .pdf indicates a PDF document, .cfg is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, .png is a PNG image, and so on.\nThis is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files merely contain bytes; it’s up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration files, images, and so on.\nNaming a PNG image of a whale as whale.mp3 doesn’t somehow magically turn it into a recording of whale song, though it might cause the operating system to associate the file with a music player program. In this case, if someone double-clicked whale.mp3 in a file explorer program, the music player will automatically (and erroneously) attempt to open the whale.mp3 file.",

In this case, we’re moving thesis/draft.txt to thesis/quotes.txt, which has the same effect as renaming the file. Sure enough, ls shows us that thesis now contains one file called quotes.txt:\n$ ls thesis\nquotes.txt\nOne must be careful when specifying the target file name, since mv will silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could lead to data loss. By default, mv will not ask for confirmation before overwriting files. However, an additional option, mv -i (or mv --interactive), will cause mv to request such confirmation.\nNote that mv also works on directories.\nLet’s move quotes.txt into the current working directory. We use mv once again, but this time we’ll use just the name of a directory as the second argument to tell mv that we want to keep the filename but put the file somewhere new. (This is why the command is called ‘move’.) In this case, the directory name we use is the special directory name . that we mentioned earlier.\n$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .\nThe effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory. ls now shows us that thesis is empty:\n$ ls thesis\n$\nAlternatively, we can confirm the file quotes.txt is no longer present in the thesis directory by explicitly trying to list it:\n$ ls thesis/quotes.txt\nls: cannot access 'thesis/quotes.txt': No such file or directory\nls with a filename or directory as an argument only lists the requested file or directory.

    "text": "Using Wildcards for Accessing Multiple Files at Once\n* is a wildcard, which represents zero or more other characters. Let’s consider the shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes directory: *.pdb represents ethane.pdb, propane.pdb, and every file that ends with ‘.pdb’. On the other hand, p*.pdb only represents pentane.pdb and propane.pdb, because the ‘p’ at the front can only represent filenames that begin with the letter ‘p’.\n? is also a wildcard, but it represents exactly one character. So ?ethane.pdb could represent methane.pdb whereas *ethane.pdb represents both ethane.pdb and methane.pdb.\nWildcards can be used in combination with each other. For example, ???ane.pdb indicates three characters followed by ane.pdb, giving cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb.\nWhen the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the preceding command. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example, typing ls *.pdf in the alkanes directory (which contains only files with names ending with .pdb) results in an error message that there is no file called *.pdf. However, generally commands like wc and ls see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that expands the wildcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: List filenames matching a pattern\n\n\n\nWhen run in the alkanes directory, which ls command(s) will produce this output?\nethane.pdb   methane.pdb\n\nls *t*ane.pdb\nls *t?ne.*\nls *t??ne.pdb\nls ethane.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is 3.\n1. shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (*) followed by the letter t, then zero or more characters (*) followed by ane.pdb. This gives ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb.\n2. shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (*) followed by the letter t, then a single character (?), then ne. followed by zero or more characters (*). This will give us octane.pdb and pentane.pdb but doesn’t match anything which ends in thane.pdb.\n3. fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (??) between t and ne. This is the solution.\n4. only shows files starting with ethane..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: More on wildcards\n\n\n\nSam has a directory containing calibration data, datasets, and descriptions of the datasets:\n.\n├── 2015-10-23-calibration.txt\n├── 2015-10-23-dataset1.txt\n├── 2015-10-23-dataset2.txt\n├── 2015-10-23-dataset_overview.txt\n├── 2015-10-26-calibration.txt\n├── 2015-10-26-dataset1.txt\n├── 2015-10-26-dataset2.txt\n├── 2015-10-26-dataset_overview.txt\n├── 2015-11-23-calibration.txt\n├── 2015-11-23-dataset1.txt\n├── 2015-11-23-dataset2.txt\n├── 2015-11-23-dataset_overview.txt\n├── backup\n│   ├── calibration\n│   └── datasets\n└── send_to_bob\n    ├── all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd\n    └── all_november_files\nBefore heading off to another field trip, she wants to back up her data and send some datasets to her colleague Bob.

The goal is to copy the folder structure of the 2016-05-18 folder into a folder called 2016-05-20 so that your final directory structure looks like this:\n2016-05-20/\n└── data\n   ├── processed\n   └── raw\nWhich of the following set of commands would achieve this objective? What would the other commands do?\n$ mkdir 2016-05-20\n$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data\n$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed\n$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw\n$ mkdir 2016-05-20\n$ cd 2016-05-20\n$ mkdir data\n$ cd data\n$ mkdir raw processed\n$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw\n$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed\n$ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/raw\n$ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/processed\n$ mkdir 2016-05-20\n$ cd 2016-05-20\n$ mkdir data\n$ mkdir raw processed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first two sets of commands achieve this objective. The first set uses relative paths to create the top-level directory before the subdirectories.\nThe third set of commands will give an error because the default behavior of mkdir won’t create a subdirectory of a non-existent directory: the intermediate level folders must be created first.\nThe fourth set of commands achieve this objective. Remember, the -p option, followed by a path of one or more directories, will cause mkdir to create any intermediate subdirectories as required.\nThe final set of commands generates the ‘raw’ and ‘processed’ directories at the same level as the ‘data’ directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\ncp [old] [new] copies a file.\nmkdir [path] creates a new directory.\nmv [old] [new] moves (renames) a file or directory.\nrm [path] removes (deletes) a file.\n* matches zero or more characters in a filename, so *.txt matches all files ending in .txt.\n? matches any single character in a filename, so ?.txt matches a.txt but not any.txt.\nUse of the Control key may be described in many ways, including Ctrl-X, Control-X, and ^X.\nThe shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it’s really gone.\nMost files’ names are something.extension. The extension isn’t required, and doesn’t guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.\nDepending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.",

    "section": "Capturing output from commands",
    "text": "Capturing output from commands\n\nOutput page by page with less\nWe’ll continue to use cat in this lesson, for convenience and consistency, but it has the disadvantage that it always dumps the whole file onto your screen. More useful in practice is the command less (e.g. less lengths.txt). This displays a screenful of the file, and then stops. You can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar, or back one by pressing b. Press q to quit.\nWhich of these files contains the fewest lines? It’s an easy question to answer when there are only six files, but what if there were 6000? Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:\n$ wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths.txt\nThe greater than symbol, &gt;, tells the shell to redirect the command’s output to a file instead of printing it to the screen. This command prints no screen output, because everything that wc would have printed has gone into the file lengths.txt instead. If the file doesn’t exist prior to issuing the command, the shell will create the file. If the file exists already, it will be silently overwritten, which may lead to data loss. Thus, redirect commands require caution.\nls lengths.txt confirms that the file exists:\n$ ls lengths.txt\nlengths.txt\nWe can now send the content of lengths.txt to the screen using cat lengths.txt. The cat command gets its name from ‘concatenate’ i.e. join together, and it prints the contents of files one after another. There’s only one file in this case, so cat just shows us what it contains:\n$ cat lengths.txt\n  20  cubane.pdb\n  12  ethane.pdb\n   9  methane.pdb\n  30  octane.pdb\n  21  pentane.pdb\n  15  propane.pdb\n 107  total\n\n\nFiltering output\nNext we’ll use the sort command to sort the contents of the lengths.txt file. But first we’ll do an exercise to learn a little about the sort command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: What does sort -n do?\n\n\n\nThe file shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/numbers.txt contains the following lines:\n10\n2\n19\n22\n6\nIf we run sort on this file, the output is:\n10\n19\n2\n22\n6\nIf we run sort -n on the same file, we get this instead:\n2\n6\n10\n19\n22\nExplain why -n has this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe -n option specifies a numerical rather than an alphanumerical sort.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will also use the -n option to specify that the sort is numerical instead of alphanumerical. This does not change the file; instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt\n  9  methane.pdb\n 12  ethane.pdb\n 15  propane.pdb\n 20  cubane.pdb\n 21  pentane.pdb\n 30  octane.pdb\n107  total\nWe can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called sorted-lengths.txt by putting &gt; sorted-lengths.txt after the command, just as we used &gt; lengths.txt to put the output of wc into lengths.txt. Once we’ve done that, we can run another command called head to get the first few lines in sorted-lengths.txt:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; sorted-lengths.txt\n$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt\n  9  methane.pdb\nUsing -n 1 with head tells it that we only want the first line of the file; -n 20 would get the first 20, and so on. Since sorted-lengths.txt contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest, the output of head must be the file with the fewest lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRedirecting to the same file\n\n\n\nIt’s a very bad idea to try redirecting the output of a command that operates on a file to the same file. For example:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; lengths.txt\nDoing something like this may give you incorrect results and/or delete the contents of lengths.txt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: What Does &gt;&gt; Mean?\n\n\n\nWe have seen the use of &gt;, but there is a similar operator &gt;&gt; which works slightly differently. We’ll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings. We can use the echo command to print strings e.g.\n$ echo The echo command prints text\nThe echo command prints text\nNow test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:\n$ echo hello &gt; testfile01.txt\nand:\n$ echo hello &gt;&gt; testfile02.txt\nHint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first example with &gt;, the string ‘hello’ is written to testfile01.txt, but the file gets overwritten each time we run the command.\nWe see from the second example that the &gt;&gt; operator also writes ‘hello’ to a file (in this case testfile02.txt), but appends the string to the file if it already exists (i.e. when we run it for the second time).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: appending data\n\n\n\nWe have already met the head command, which prints lines from the start of a file. tail is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file instead.\nConsider the file shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts/animals.csv. After these commands, select the answer that corresponds to the file animals-subset.csv:\n$ head -n 3 animals.csv &gt; animals-subset.csv\n$ tail -n 2 animals.csv &gt;&gt; animals-subset.csv\n\nThe first three lines of animals.csv\nThe last two lines of animals.csv\nThe first three lines and the last two lines of animals.csv\nThe second and third lines of animals.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 3 is correct. For option 1 to be correct we would only run the head command. For option 2 to be correct we would only run the tail command. For option 4 to be correct we would have to pipe the output of head into tail -n 2 by doing head -n 3 animals.csv | tail -n 2 &gt; animals-subset.csv",

This is a confusing way to work because even once you understand what wc, sort, and head do, those intermediate files make it hard to follow what’s going on. We can make it easier to understand by running sort and head together:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1\n  9  methane.pdb\nThe vertical bar, |, between the two commands is called a pipe.

    "section": "Tools designed to work together",
    "text": "Tools designed to work together\nThis idea of linking programs together is why Unix has been so successful. Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things, Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well, and that work well with each other. This programming model is called ‘pipes and filters’. We’ve already seen pipes; a filter is a program like wc or sort that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output. Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way. Unless told to do otherwise, they read from standard input, do something with what they’ve read, and write to standard output.\nThe key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input and writes lines of text to standard output can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well. You can and should write your programs this way so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Pipe Reading Comprehension\n\n\n\nA file called animals.csv (in the shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts folder) contains the following data:\n2012-11-05,deer,5\n2012-11-05,rabbit,22\n2012-11-05,raccoon,7\n2012-11-06,rabbit,19\n2012-11-06,deer,2\n2012-11-06,fox,4\n2012-11-07,rabbit,16\n2012-11-07,bear,1\nWhat text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below? Note, the sort -r command sorts in reverse order.\n$ cat animals.csv | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r &gt; final.txt\nHint: build the pipeline up one command at a time to test your understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe head command extracts the first 5 lines from animals.csv. Then, the last 3 lines are extracted from the previous 5 by using the tail command. With the sort -r command those 3 lines are sorted in reverse order. Finally, the output is redirected to a file: final.txt. The content of this file can be checked by executing cat final.txt. The file should contain the following lines:\n2012-11-06,rabbit,19\n2012-11-06,deer,2\n2012-11-05,raccoon,7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Pipe Construction\n\n\n\nFor the file animals.csv from the previous exercise, consider the following command:\n$ cut -d , -f 2 animals.csv\nThe cut command is used to remove or ‘cut out’ certain sections of each line in the file, and cut expects the lines to be separated into columns by a Tab character. A character used in this way is called a delimiter. In the example above we use the -d option to specify the comma as our delimiter character. We have also used the -f option to specify that we want to extract the second field (column). This gives the following output:\ndeer\nrabbit\nraccoon\nrabbit\ndeer\nfox\nrabbit\nbear\nThe uniq command filters out adjacent matching lines in a file. How could you extend this pipeline (using uniq and another command) to find out what animals the file contains (without any duplicates in their names)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n$ cut -d , -f 2 animals.csv | sort | uniq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Which Pipe?\n\n\n\nThe file animals.csv contains 8 lines of data formatted as follows:\n2012-11-05,deer,5\n2012-11-05,rabbit,22\n2012-11-05,raccoon,7\n2012-11-06,rabbit,19\n...\nThe uniq command has a -c option which gives a count of the number of times a line occurs in its input. Assuming your current directory is shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts, what command would you use to produce a table that shows the total count of each type of animal in the file?\n\nsort animals.csv | uniq -c\nsort -t, -k2,2 animals.csv | uniq -c\ncut -d, -f 2 animals.csv | uniq -c\ncut -d, -f 2 animals.csv | sort | uniq -c\ncut -d, -f 2 animals.csv | sort | uniq -c | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 4. is the correct answer. If you have difficulty understanding why, try running the commands, or sub-sections of the pipelines (make sure you are in the shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts directory).",

When you go back and check it, you see that you did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning — someone was probably in using the machine on the weekend, and you forgot to reset it. Before re-running that sample, you check to see if any files have too much data:\n$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5\n 300 NENE02040B.txt\n 300 NENE02040Z.txt\n 300 NENE02043A.txt\n 300 NENE02043B.txt\n5040 total\nThose numbers look good — but what’s that ‘Z’ doing there in the third-to-last line? All of your samples should be marked ‘A’ or ‘B’; by convention, your lab uses ‘Z’ to indicate samples with missing information. To find others like it, you do this:\n$ ls *Z.txt\nNENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt\nSure enough, when you check the log on your laptop, there’s no depth recorded for either of those samples. Since it’s too late to get the information any other way, you must exclude those two files from your analysis.

    "text": "Your pipeline: Processing files\nYou are now ready to process your data files using goostats.sh — a shell script written by your supervisor. This calculates some statistics from a protein sample file and takes two arguments:\n\nan input file (containing the raw data)\nan output file (to store the calculated statistics)\n\nSince you are still learning how to use the shell, you decides to build up the required commands in stages. Your first step is to make sure that you can select the right input files — remember, these are ones whose names end in ‘A’ or ‘B’, rather than ‘Z’. Moving to the north-pacific-gyre directory, you type:\n$ cd\n$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/north-pacific-gyre\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt\n&gt; do\n&gt;     echo $datafile\n&gt; done\nNENE01729A.txt\nNENE01736A.txt\nNENE01751A.txt\n\n...\nNENE02040B.txt\nNENE02043B.txt\nYour next step is to decide what to call the files that the goostats.sh analysis program will create. Prefixing each input file’s name with ‘stats’ seems simple, so you modify your loop to do that:\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt\n&gt; do\n&gt;     echo $datafile stats-$datafile\n&gt; done\nNENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt\nNENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt\nNENE01751A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt\n...\nNENE02040B.txt stats-NENE02040B.txt\nNENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt\nYou haven’t actually run goostats.sh yet, but now you’re sure you can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.\nTyping in commands over and over again is becoming tedious, though, and you are worried about making mistakes, so instead of re-entering your loop, you press ↑. In response, the shell re-displays the whole loop on one line (using semi-colons to separate the pieces):\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done\nUsing the ←, you navigate to the echo command and change it to bash goostats.sh:\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done\nWhen you press Enter, the shell runs the modified command. However, nothing appears to happen — there is no output. After a moment, you realize that since your script doesn’t print anything to the screen any longer, you has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly. You kill the running command by typing Ctrl+C, uses ↑ to repeat the command, and edit it to read:\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile;\nbash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBeginning and end\n\n\n\nWe can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing Ctrl+A and to the end using Ctrl+E.\n\n\nWhen you run your program now, it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:\nNENE01729A.txt\nNENE01736A.txt\nNENE01751A.txt\n...\n1518 times 5 seconds, divided by 60, tells her that her script will take about two hours to run. As a final check, you open another terminal window, go into north-pacific-gyre, and uses cat stats-NENE01729B.txt to examine one of the output files. It looks good, so you decides to get some coffee and catch up on your reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThose who know history can choose to repeat it\n\n\n\nAnother way to repeat previous work is to use the history command to get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and then to use !123 (where ‘123’ is replaced by the command number) to repeat one of those commands. For example, if you types this:\n$ history | tail -n 5\n456  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do   echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n457  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n458  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n459  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile; bash goostats.sh $datafile\nstats-$datafile; done\n460  history | tail -n 5\nthen you can re-run goostats.sh on the files simply by typing !459.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMore history commands\n\n\n\nThere are a number of other shortcut commands for getting at the history.\n\nCtrl+R enters a history search mode ‘reverse-i-search’ and finds the most recent command in your history that matches the text you enter next. Press Ctrl+R one or more additional times to search for earlier matches. You can then use the left and right arrow keys to choose that line and edit it then hit Return to run the command.\n!! retrieves the immediately preceding command (you may or may not find this more convenient than using ↑)\n!$ retrieves the last word of the last command. That’s useful more often than you might expect: after bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt, you can type less !$ to look at the file stats-NENE01729B.txt, which is quicker than doing ↑ and editing the command-line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nA for loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.\nEvery for loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on.\nUse $name to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). ${name} can also be used.\nDo not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as ‘*’ or ‘?’ in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.\nGive files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.\nUse the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.\nUse Ctrl+R to search through the previously entered commands.\nUse history to display recent commands, and ![number] to repeat a command by number.",

    "text": "Your pipeline: Creating a script\nYour supervisor insisted that all your analytics must be reproducible. The easiest way to capture all the steps is in a script.\nFirst we return to your project directory:\n$ cd ../../north-pacific-gyre/\nYou create a file using nano …\n$ nano do-stats.sh\n…which contains the following:\n# Calculate stats for data files.\nfor datafile in \"$@\"\ndo\n    echo $datafile\n    bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile\ndone\nYou save this in a file called do-stats.sh so that you can now re-do the first stage of your analysis by typing:\n$ bash do-stats.sh NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt\nYou can also do this:\n$ bash do-stats.sh NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt | wc -l\nso that the output is just the number of files processed rather than the names of the files that were processed.\nOne thing to note about your script is that it lets the person running it decide what files to process. You could have written it as:\n# Calculate stats for Site A and Site B data files.\nfor datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt\ndo\n    echo $datafile\n    bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile\ndone\nThe advantage is that this always selects the right files: you doesn’t have to remember to exclude the ‘Z’ files. The disadvantage is that it always selects just those files — you can’t run it on all files (including the ‘Z’ files), or on the ‘G’ or ‘H’ files your colleagues in Antarctica are producing, without editing the script. If you wanted to be more adventurous, you could modify your script to check for command-line arguments, and use NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt if none were provided. Of course, this introduces another tradeoff between flexibility and complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Variables in shell scripts\n\n\n\nIn the alkanes directory, imagine you have a shell script called script.sh containing the following commands:\nhead -n $2 $1\ntail -n $3 $1\nWhile you are in the alkanes directory, you type the following command:\n$ bash script.sh '*.pdb' 1 1\nWhich of the following outputs would you expect to see?\n\nAll of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file ending in .pdb in the alkanes directory\nThe first and the last line of each file ending in .pdb in the alkanes directory\nThe first and the last line of each file in the alkanes directory\nAn error because of the quotes around *.pdb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correct answer is 2.\nThe special variables $1, $2 and $3 represent the command line arguments given to the script, such that the commands run are:\n$ head -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb\n$ tail -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb\nThe shell does not expand '*.pdb' because it is enclosed by quote marks. As such, the first argument to the script is '*.pdb' which gets expanded within the script by head and tail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Find the longest file with a given extension\n\n\n\nWrite a shell script called longest.sh that takes the name of a directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory with that extension. For example:\n$ bash longest.sh shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes pdb\nwould print the name of the .pdb file in shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes that has the most lines.\nFeel free to test your script on another directory e.g.\n$ bash longest.sh shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n# Shell script which takes two arguments:\n#    1. a directory name\n#    2. a file extension\n# and prints the name of the file in that directory\n# with the most lines which matches the file extension.\n\nwc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1\nThe first part of the pipeline, wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n, counts the lines in each file and sorts them numerically (largest last). When there’s more than one file, wc also outputs a final summary line, giving the total number of lines across all files. We use tail -n 2 | head -n 1 to throw away this last line.\nWith wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 1 we’ll see the final summary line: we can build our pipeline up in pieces to be sure we understand the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Script reading comprehension\n\n\n\nFor this question, consider the shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes directory once again. This contains a number of .pdb files in addition to any other files you may have created. Explain what each of the following three scripts would do when run as bash script1.sh *.pdb, bash script2.sh *.pdb, and bash script3.sh *.pdb respectively.\n# Script 1\necho *.*\n# Script 2\nfor filename in $1 $2 $3\ndo\n    cat $filename\ndone\n# Script 3\necho $@.pdb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn each case, the shell expands the wildcard in *.pdb before passing the resulting list of file names as arguments to the script.\nScript 1 would print out a list of all files containing a dot in their name. The arguments passed to the script are not actually used anywhere in the script.\nScript 2 would print the contents of the first 3 files with a .pdb file extension. $1, $2, and $3 refer to the first, second, and third argument respectively.\nScript 3 would print all the arguments to the script (i.e. all the .pdb files), followed by .pdb. $@ refers to all the arguments given to a shell script.\ncubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb.pdb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nSave commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use.\nbash [filename] runs the commands saved in a file.\n$@ refers to all of a shell script’s command-line arguments.\n$1, $2, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc.\nPlace variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them.\nLetting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.",

However, the CLI is the most powerful means to manage a Git repository, and (once you know how to use it) I have found it to be more straight forward than VS Code’s implementation.

    "text": "Git vs. GitHub\nBefore diving into using git, it’s necessary to understand the difference between Git and GitHub.\nGit is a program that you run on a computer to track changes to your files and enable collaboration. It is a type of version control software. Git was created by Linus Torvalds (the guy who invented Linux) in 2005 for Linux kernel development.\nFiles are tracked in a repository. A repository is just a folder on your computer that you’ve told Git to track.\nGitHub is a cloud platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code development. It is owned by Microsoft. You can interact with GitHub through their website at github.com. Basically, GitHub is a collection of remote computers owned by Microsoft that have a bunch of Git repositories on them. GitHub uses Git to manage repositories.\nOnce you create an account with GitHub, you are able to create remote repositories on their servers. You can then copy, or clone those remote repositories to your local computer. On your local computer, you use Git to make modifications to the repository, then push those changes back to the copy at GitHub in order to keep them in sync.\nHere is a diagram illustrating the relationship (this diagram also includes a fork, which is your copy of someone else’s repository, both of which live on GitHub):\n\n\n\nDiagram illustrating clones, forks, and branches. Here, userB creates a fork of userA’s repository on GitHub. userA and userB each have a clone of the repository on their local computers. Within each user’s fork of the repository they have different branches (in userA’s repos they are main and dev1; in userB, main and br1).",

When you click on it, you will be prompted to link a GitHub account. Select your name to do so. Once you do, GitHub will create a repository for you. This repository will be your classroom notebook. As we continue through the rest of the semester, you will commit and push tutorials and scripts that you create in class to this repository. You will have separate, similar repositories for each homework assignment.\nTo clone the repository we will use VS Code. There is a way to do this using the CLI, but this is one instance where using VS Code is a bit easier as VS Code will take care of authentication for you.\nTo clone the repo using VS Code:\n\nUse your web browser to navigate to your classroom notebook repository on GitHub.\nClick the green “Code” button in the upper left. That will open a drop-down menu. Make sure the HTTPS tab is selected, then copy the URL that’s listed there (you can just click the copy icon to the right to copy the URL).\nOpen VS Code.\nIn VS Code, open the command palette by hitting Ctrl/Command + Shift + P on the keyboard. In the command palette prompt at the top, type gitcl, then select “Git: Clone” from the drop-down menu.\n\n\nIf you have not logged into GitHub previously in VS Code, you will be prompted to log in. If so, log in. After you do, you’ll need to open the command palette again, type gitcl, and select “Git: Clone”.\n\n\nPaste the URL you copied from GitHub into the command palette then hit Enter.\nYou will be prompted where to store the repository. Select the ist356 directory we created last week. Then click the “Select as Repository Destination” button.\nYou will be asked whether to open or open in a new window. To make sure we’re not mixing up projects, select “Open in a New Window”. This will open a new VS Code Window with the contents on the cloned repository.\nNote that you now have a folder in your ist356 directory called class-notebook. The class-notebook folder is your local copy of the class-notebook repository. It is a folder like any folder on your computer, except that it has been marked by Git to track changes that are made within it. This is what makes it a repository.\nAt this point, the repository just has a README.md file. We will create files and folders in this repository as we go forward.\nYou can view the status of the repository using the command line. Open a terminal (click Terminal -&gt; New Terminal). You should be in your class-notebook folder (run pwd to check). If not, cd into class-notebook. Now type:\ngit status\n\nYou will get back a message indicating that everything is up to date.",

You can stage multiple files at once by listing them (putting a space between each file name).\nCommit the changes to the file by typing:\ngit commit -m \"MY COMMIT MESSAGE\"\nHere, MY COMMIT MESSAGE is the log you want for the commit. Be brief but descriptive!\nWhen you are done making changes to your local repository and want to sync them back to GitHub, type:\n\ngit push\nIf you get an error saying that you can't push due to your local not being up to date with the remote, run `git pull` first.\n\nVerify the changes have been synced to GitHub by refreshing the repo’s page in your web browser. You should see the same history.",

Good for commands that should only run once when you log in (e.g., setting environment variables).\n~/.bashrc\nRuns for interactive non-login shells. Good for commands you want every interactive shell to run (e.g., aliases, functions).\n\nOn many systems, .bash_profile will call .bashrc so settings apply in both contexts.\n\nTip: If unsure where to put something, put it in .bashrc and make sure .bash_profile sources .bashrc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUsing Zsh?\n\n\n\nIf your default shell is zsh (common on macOS Catalina and later), the equivalent files are: - ~/.zprofile – similar to .bash_profile - ~/.zshrc – similar to .bashrc\nConfiguration changes should go into ~/.zshrc for most use cases.\n\n\nYou can put any bash command you like in these scripts to further customize your shell. For example, you can configure your shell so that pressing the up arrow searches backward through your command history for commands starting with the text you have typed, and the down arrow searches forward with:\n\nfor bash (add this to your ~/.bashrc):\nbind '\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward'\nbind '\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward'\nfor Zsh (add this to your ~/.zshrc):\nbindkey \"^[[A\" history-search-backward\nbindkey \"^[[B\" history-search-forward",
